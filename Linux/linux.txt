ls -LS > test.txt :: > copies the content of ls to test.txt 

cat test.txt -- used to display the content of file
even less.txt  can display the conetnt of file, but ti displays it in a seprate window(it helps to keep ur workspace less fluttered)
cat -b less.txt - adds line no to filled lines and if blank line it skips the balnk line	
cat -n less.txt - adds line no to all lines

ls /home/edureka/public/ == to see files in particular folder

mkdir Demo (its's in blue then it;s a diretory)
