diff bet dll and lib::

LIB is a static library where functions and procedures can be placed and called as the application is being compiled. 
A DLL or Dynamic Link Library does the same function but is dynamic in a sense that the application can call these 
libraries during run-time and not during the compilation.

1. A DLL is a library that contains functions that can be called by applications at run-time while LIB is a static library 
   whose code needs to be called during the compilation
2. Using LIB would result in a single file that is considerable bigger while you end up with multiple smaller files with DLL’s
3. DLL’s are more reusable than LIBs when writing new versions or totally new applications
4. DLL files can be used by other applications while LIB files cannot
5. DLL’s are prone to versioning problems while LIB is not
6. You would still have a LIB file when developing software with DLLs but it only contains stubs

A program database file (extension .pdb) is a binary file that contains type and symbolic debugging information gathered 
over the course of compiling and linking the project. A PDB file is created when you compile a C/C++ program with /ZI or /Zi 
or a Visual Basic, Visual C#, or JScript program with the /debug option.
