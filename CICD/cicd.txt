CI and CD stand for continuous integration and continuous delivery/continuous deployment. 
In very simple terms, CI is a modern software development practice in which incremental code changes are made frequently 
and reliably. Automated build-and-test steps triggered by CI ensure that code changes being merged into the repository are reliable. 
The code is then delivered quickly and seamlessly as a part of the CD process. In the software world, the CI/CD pipeline refers
to the automation that enables incremental code changes from developersâ€™ desktops 
to be delivered quickly and reliably to production.
