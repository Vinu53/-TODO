A computer is a programmable electronic device that accepts raw data as input and processes it with a set of instructions (a program)
 to produce the result as output. 
 
An operating system is a piece of software that manages all the resources of a computer system, 
both hardware and software, and provides an environment in which the user can execute his/her 
programs in a convenient and efficient manner.

The World Wide Web -- also known as the web, WWW or W3 -- refers to all the public websites or pages that users can access on their local computers 
and other devices through the internet.

Client-server model















API is the acronym for application programming interface â€” a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. 
APIs are an accessible way to extract and share data within and across organizations.

1) REST APIs: REST stands for Representational State Transfer. These APIs use HTTP requests to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data.
 REST APIs are widely used for web services and mobile applications.

2) SOAP APIs: SOAP stands for Simple Object Access Protocol. These APIs use XML-based messaging to exchange data between applications. 
SOAP APIs are commonly used in enterprise applications.

3)GraphQL APIs: GraphQL is a query language that allows clients to request specific data from a server.
 GraphQL APIs are used for applications that require complex queries and data manipulation.

4) Webhooks: Webhooks allow applications to receive real-time notifications when specific events occur.
 This type of API is commonly used in chat applications and notification services.

5)  OpenAPIs: OpenAPI (formerly known as Swagger) is a specification for building APIs. 
OpenAPIs define the format of the request and response payloads, the endpoints of the API, and the authentication methods used.

6) Real-time APIs: Real-time APIs allow applications to exchange data in real-time, enabling real-time communication
 and collaboration between applications.

These are just a few examples of the different types of APIs that are available. The choice of API depends on the specific needs of the application and the data being exchanged.
