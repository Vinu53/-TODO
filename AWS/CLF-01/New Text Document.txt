KMS encryption - RSD , EBS

free services - CLF, VPC , • IAM
• VPC
• Consolidated Billing
• Elastic Beanstalk
• CloudFormation
• Auto Scaling Groups

ELB And ASG, AMI - Regional

High Avaliability == FAult tolerance

IAM

 Analyze access patterns & review permissions - iam asccess advisor
 Audit permissions of your account with the IAM Credentials Report

security groups

 Can be attached to multiple instances
• Locked down to a region / VPC combination
 If your application is not accessible (time out), then it’s a security group issue
• If your application gives a “connection refused“ error, then it’s an application 
error or it’s not launched

billing per second, after the first minute - on demand

AMI - regoin scopic,  EBS - AZ, EFS - multi AZ

Replication for data for EBS  volumes & EFS drives -  aws respondibility

Datasync - to send data

cloudwatch events or eventbridge -- serverless

codedeploy == v1 to v2

 Chef & Puppet help you perform server configuration automatically, or 
repetitive actions

Bring AWS resources (compute, database, storage, …) closer to your users - local zones
DDoS Protection is not available with Route 53

 3 types of budgets: Usage, Cost, Reservation

 Infrastructure Event Management, Well-Architected & Operations Reviews - Enterprice 

Savings Plans: easy way to save based on long-term usage of AWS

workspace - Daas - multiple regions

SNS - push based system
SQS - PUll based system

flexible start and end time - spot//

pay less by using more = economies of scale
pay as u go -  reduce capital expenditure

colocation facility and ISP == AWS direct connect

use the idel cpu resources - elsaticity

WAF can be attavhed to -- CFnt and APP LoBL

compute optimizer - EC2, ASG, EBS, Lambda

1- baseline intergration with ISTM tools
2 - Alignment with ITIL Process

quick sight - serverless

403 error s3 bucker policy
503 error The application is unresponsive so the ELB instance serves the 504 error page

hypervosor is responsible for Multi Tenancy (managed by AWS)
The hypervisor is responsible for isolating the virtual machines from each other as they share 
resources from the host.

// If applications communicate directly like our cashier and barista previously, this is called being tightly coupled.
 
loosely coupled. This is an architecture where if one component fails, it is isolated and therefore won't cause cascading failures throughout the whole system. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you weren't quite ready for serverless yet or you need access to the underlying environment, but still want
 efficiency and portability, you should look at AWS container services like Amazon Elastic Container
 Service, otherwise known as ECS. Or Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service, otherwise known as EKS. 

containers run on top of ec2 instances, so u can manage containers

Kubernetes is open-source software that enables you to deploy and manage containerized applications at scale.

sqs, sns , kinesis == serverless(aws managed)
RDS - Database encryption setting - customer respons

WAF & ACM : can be Deployed on Application Load Balancer, API Gateway, CloudFront

Questions that can be solved by AWS Config: 
• Is there unrestricted SSH access to my security groups?
• Do my buckets have any public access?
• How has my ALB configuration changed over time?

AWS compute optimizer ::
C2 instances • EC2 Auto Scaling Groups • EBS volumes • Lambda functions

Listeners, Targets, and Target Groups round robin = Application load balancer 

VPC falls is  Networking and Content Delivery category

Distribution : represents a series of Edge Locations plus information about how you want content managed as part of a CDN
